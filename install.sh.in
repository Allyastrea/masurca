PARAMETERS
#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 101 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content

#set this to 1 for Illumina-only assemblies and to 0 if you have 2x or more long (Sanger, 454) reads
USE_LINKING_MATES=1
#this parameter is useful if you have too many jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and something large (300) for mammals
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 60
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler.  do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically. for mammals do not set cgwErrorRate above 0.15!!!

#this is mandatory jellyfish hash size
